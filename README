About
=====

Guile-Gnome is a Guile wrapper collection for most of the GNOME core
libraries. Guile-Gnome brings the power of Scheme to your graphical
application: from Pango to GnomeCanvas, Gtk+ to GStreamer, Glade to
GtkSourceView, you will find in Guile-Gnome a comprehensive
environment for developing modern applications:

		(cons 'guile 'gnome)

Each wrapper is contained within its own subdirectory, for instance
glib/ or gstreamer/.  For information on the individual wrappers, see
the documentation in their subdirs.


Installing
==========

Guile-Gnome will try to build the following wrappers:

    atk, cairo, corba, gconf, glib, gnome-vfs, gtk, libglade,
    libgnome, libgnomecanvas, libgnomeui, pango.

Prerequisites
-------------

* All wrappers:

    - Autoconf >= 2.61
    - Automake >= 1.12
    - Guile-2.0 or Guile-2.2
    - Guile-Lib >= 0.2.2	http://www.nongnu.org/guile-lib/
    - G-Wrap >= 1.9.15 		http://www.nongnu.org/g-wrap/
    - Guile-Cairo >= 1.10	http://www.nongnu.org/guile-cairo/


    Note that at the time we write, Guile-Cairo 1.10 has not been
    released yey, it will hopefully soon be the case.  In the mean
    time, the required bleeding edge Guile-Cairo stable version must
    be obtained from the source, see:

      http://www.nongnu.org/guile-cairo/dev/

* Specific wrappers:

Here are the dependencies Guile-Gnome will check, during its
configurestep, in order to decide which wrappers it can build. Some
GNU Linux distributions require you to install corresponding '-dev'
packages, not just the core libraries packages.

    - Atk >= 1.12
    - Corba [(and libbonobo-2.0 Orbit-2.0)]
    - gconf-2.0 >= 2.18
    - glib-2.0 >= 2.10.0
    - gobject-2.0
    - gthread-2.0
    - gnome-vfs-2.0 >= 2.16.0
    - gdk-pixbuf-2.0 >= 2.10.0
    - gdk-2.0 >= 2.10.0
    - gtk+-2.0 >= 2.10.0
    - libglade-2.0 >= 2.6
    - libgnome-2.0 >= 2.16
    - libgnomecanvas-2.0 >= 2.14
    - libgnomeui-2.0 >= 2.16.0
    - pango >= 1.14
    - pangocairo >= 1.14

Instructions
------------

For detailed, general instructions, see the file INSTALL.

* Building from a tarball

Once all [or the appropriate subset of the GNOME core libraries you
wish to wrap] dependencies are statisfied, open a terminal and:

    cd <download-path>
    tar zxf guile-gnome-<version>.tar.gz
    cd guile-gnome-<version>
    ./configure [--prefix=/your/prefix]
    make
    make install

Notes:

(1) During the configure step, Guile-Gnome will list the wrappers it
    will buid.  You have to scroll-up or edit the config.log file and
    search for 'available wrappers' to see this important feedback

(2) In the above configure step, --prefix=/your/prefix is
    optional. The default value is /usr/local.

(3) To install Guile-Gnome, you must have write permissions to the
    following directories:

	- $prefix and its subdirs
	- Guile's global site directory

    You may check Guile's global site directory using:

	guile -c "(display (%global-site-dir)) (newline)"

Guile-Gnome's modules will be installed in
    $prefix/share/guile-gnome-2, and the file gnome-2.scm will be
    installed in Guile's globasl site directory.

(4) In case you need to augment Guile's load paths [for your own
    Guile-Gnome application(s) for example], you can: (a)
    create/update your personnal ~/.guile file, (b) update Guile's
    global site located init.scm file or (c) define/update your
    GUILE_LOAD_PATH shell environment variable.

(5) Like for any other GNU Tool Chain compatible software, you may
    install the documentation locally using make install-info, make
    install-html and/or make install-pdf.

stack of libraries.  See the README, for more information.


guile-gnome-platform 2.16.3 - David Pirotte, 2015-06-02
=======================================================

The primary objectives, working towards this release, were (1) to
remove all code specific to the support of guile versions prior to
guile 2, (2) getting rid of all guile related deprecated messages
[that second part of the mission almost completed, there is still one
corba related deprecated warning message, help to resolve that last
one is welcome!], and (3) wrap gdk_pixbuf_get_pixels requested by
guile-clutter 1.12.

None 'specific' changes
-----------------------

* scm-error incorrect arg list, various calls, all fixed.

* Toplevel calls moved into an eval-when conditions exp...

* make check and make distcheck both have been fixed to work with
  recent automake versions [thanks to Ludovic Courtés for his help wrt
  to make check]

corba
-----

* fixing allocate-instance for <CORBA:Object>

glib
----

* g_get_current_time now [temporarily] ignored, it was not properly
  wrapped anyway.

* <glib-wrapset> missing some basic pointer types: guint8*, guchar*,
  gunichar*, gunichar2* added and wrapped as opaque pointers.

* scm_c_gparam_construct 4th argument type definition fixed

* use &gw-bad-typespec, not &gw:bad-typespec, fixed.

gdk-pixbuf
----------

* gdk_pixbuf_get_pixels removed from the ignore list, it returns a
  guchar*, just added, no specific wrapper needed.

gtk
---

* gtk_recent_info_get_application_info should [temporarily] be
  ignored, it needs a special wrapper, to be done still.


guile-gnome-platform 2.16.2 -- 2012-09-05
=========================================

packaging changes
-----------------
* Instead of the terribly complicated revision control configuration
  that we had before, now all code is in git, and in just one branch.
  The build files like Makefile.am and configure.ac are no longer
  generated from other files.

* Update to support Guile 2.0 in addition to 1.8.  (We don't currently
  install compiled .go files yet.)

* Require G-Wrap 1.9.14.

* If Guile is new enough, tab completion at the REPL will cause all
  "latent" bindings to become present.  This makes it easier to explore
  the API.

glib
----
* Fix generation of code that produces errors when compiled when
  wrapping GList* types.

gtk
---
* Fix some instances of allocating boxed types with g_new0 instead of
  the boxed type's own copy function.  Thanks to Greg Benison and
  Patrick Bernaud.

* Fix linking error regarding libgw-guile-gnome-gtk and libguile-cairo.
  Thanks to Andreas Rottmann.

* Add overrides with parameter annotations for methods of
  GtkPrintOperation (bug #603211).  Thanks to Patrick Bernaud.

* Add wrapper for gtk_tree_view_get_path_at_pos().  Thanks to Patrick
  Bernaud.

* Fix up some of the example files for 2.16.0 API.  Thanks to Patrick
  Bernaud.

* The GtkTextBuffer API now uses UTF-8 for Guile 2.0.  Thanks to Mark
  Weaver.  There is more work to do regarding UTF-8 and Guile 2.0,
  though.

libglade
--------
* Fix automatic connection of signals to handlers (bug #605248).  Thanks
  to Patrick Bernaud.


guile-gnome-platform 2.16.1 - Andy Wingo, 2008-07-03
====================================================

packaging changes
-----------------
* Removed the "docs" module; its content, the tutorial, is now folded
  into the documentation for all of the relevant modules (e.g. GLib,
  GTK+, CORBA, etc.)

* Changelogs have all been archived to ChangeLog.pre-2.16, because now
  we will just use revision control logs.

* Suppress some automake warnings.

* Add guile-clutter to the set of configurable packages.

atk
---
* Improved documentation.

corba
-----
* Improved documentation, folding the tutorial text in to the (gnome
  corba) module commentary.

* Removed a printf.

defs
----
* New platform release, no change.

gconf
-----
* Imroved documentation, with example.

* Fixed a bug regarding GConfClient notification.

glib
----
* Improved documentation.

* Build process is slightly less noisy.

* Recognize GInitiallyUnowned as a sinkable object.

This doesn't affect e.g. GTK+, for which we already recognize GtkObject
as sinkable, but it does affect e.g. Clutter.

* Don't error when constructing parameter types of which we are unaware.

Affects e.g. ClutterUnit parameters; the precise nature of this fix will
change in the future.
  
* Accept integers as init values for <gchar> or <guchar> values.

* Bugfix for custom-wrapped boxed values, like GdkRectangle.

* Fix regressions on x86-64.

gnome-vfs
---------
* Improved documentation, with some example code.

gtk
---
* Improved documentation, merging in content from the tutorial into the
  main GTK+ docs.

libglade
--------
* Improved documentation, with an example.

libgnome
--------
* Improved documentation.

libgnomecanvas
--------------
* Improved documentation.

libgnomeui
----------
* Improved documentation.

pango
-----
* Added (gnome pangocairo) module, along with documentation.


guile-gnome-platform 2.15.98 - Andy Wingo, 2008-04-25
=====================================================

packaging changes
-----------------
* Formally require Guile 1.8, as has been the case for a while now.

* Bump the API_VERSION to 2, as a test before going stable.

This will change all library names, pkg-config names, installed header
names, etc. (use-modules (gnome-0)) in user code should be changed to
(use-modules (gnome-2)). guile-gnome-0 is now guile-gnome-2.

The purpose of this change is to shake out any bugs in the API_VERSION
mechanism. The intention is for the next release to be 2.16.0, with
API_VERSION=2.

atk
---
* Documentation updated.

gconf
-----
* Documentation updated.

* Don't use API deprecated in Guile 1.8.

glib
----
* API changes: Made gtype-interface-destroy! public. Removed the
  terrible %especify-metaclass! as it is not used.

* Documentation updated.

* Don't use API deprecated in Guile 1.8.

* A few bugfixes after the large changes in 2.15.97.

gnome-vfs
---------
* Documentation updated.

* Don't use API deprecated in Guile 1.8.

gtk
---
* Documentation updated.

* Don't use API deprecated in Guile 1.8.

* Remove special wrapper for <gtk-message-dialog>, as GTK+ 2.10 has
  enough of a gobject property interface.

libglade
--------
* Documentation updated.

libgnome
--------
* Documentation updated.

* Don't use API deprecated in Guile 1.8.

libgnomecanvas
--------------
* Documentation updated.

* Don't use API deprecated in Guile 1.8.

pango
-----
* Documentation updated.

* Don't use API deprecated in Guile 1.8.


guile-gnome-platform 2.15.97 - Andy Wingo, 2008-04-10
=====================================================

corba
-----
* Adapt to changes in (gnome gobject). corba-typecode->gtype-class is
  the new name for corba-typecode->gtype.

* Compilation fix if BONOBO_EX is already defined.

gconf
-----
* Adapt to changes in (gnome gobject).

glib
----
* Major rewrite of low-level (gnome gobject) code. 

GTypes are no longer exposed to Scheme. Instead, types are represented
directly as <gtype-class> instances.

Internally, <gtype-class> instances know their GType, because is stored
in a <read-only-slot>, which stores a raw (untagged) word -- the perfect
size for a GType.

Similarly, I also removed the need for <%gtype-instance> smobs as well,
through interesting trickery: the GOOPS objects directly store the
GTypeInstance* pointer in a <read-only-slot>. The trickery is that we
can be notified when the struct is collected, via monkeypatching the
<gtype-class> objects to free via a custom function,
scm_gtype_instance_struct_free. This allows us to unref the object.

The same strategy was applied to GValue wrappers. With this change,
Guile-GNOME no longer holds C data in SMOBs.

Removing the <gtype>, <%gtype-class>, <%gtype-instance>, and primitive
<gvalue> types has allowed for the removal of much useless,
non-orthogonal glue API.

Signals and parameters are also represented natively with GOOPS objects,
not structures. There is no overhead for this, as GOOPS objects are in
fact structures, whose VTable is their class.

This is an incompatible change, but one which allows me to commit to a
stable API/ABI, perhaps in the next release.

Please test your programs against this version, so that I can help you
port, and so that we can make sure that the API is fine.

gnome-vfs
---------
* Adapt to changes in (gnome gobject).

gtk
---
* New function wrapper: gtk-widget-get-state.

* Reintroduce gtk-menu-popup wrapper, this time supporting the menu
  positioning function.

* Adapt to changes in (gnome gobject).

* Interface changes: Tree models now deal in <gtype-class> instances,
  now that there are no more GType objects. This applies to the list
  store, tree store, and the generic tree model.

* Make the texinfo viewer understand more kinds of @def commands.

libglade
--------
* Adapt to changes in (gnome gobject).

libgnomecanvas
--------------
* Compilation fixes with picky compilers.


guile-gnome-platform 2.15.96 - Andy Wingo, 2007-12-10
=====================================================

packaging changes
-----------------
* Support a variant of check-coverage that generates a texinfo file with
  the missing functions.

* Various buildfixes for building out-of-tree modules such as
  guile-gnome-gstreamer.

atk
---
* API review. Lots of interface types actually declared.

* Documentation changes: add type index, section for undocumented
  exports, regenerated for changes resulting from API review.

cairo
-----
* Remove (gnome cairo), as we have no actual public API.

corba
-----
* Add automatically generated documentation and API regression tests.
  The docs need some work, however.

docs
----
* Minor updates.

gconf
-----
* API review.

* Documentation changes: add type index, section for undocumented
  exports, regenerated for changes resulting from API review.

glib
----
* API review.

* Documentation changes: add type index, section for undocumented
  exports, regenerated for changes resulting from API review.

* Bugfix: avoid SCM_STRING_CHARS in core (gnome gobject) code, which
  will raise an exception when called on shared substrings.

* Fixes to the fifo.scm example, which uses GIOChannel.

* Leave guile mode at the right time in g-main-loop-run, fixing some
  hangs.

* Change to the wrapset generator to no longer silently wrap opaque
  types; instead, functions that reference unknown types are ignored,
  and a warning is printed out. Requires more discipline when making
  wrapsets, but reduces random crap being wrapped.

* Add support for appending a list of undocumented functions to the
  generated documentation.

* Add support for wrapping more kinds of C structures: freeable
  pointers, generic refcounted pointers, and destructurable values. See
  the changes to (gnome gw support gobject) for more information.

gnome-vfs
---------
* API review.

* Documentation changes: add type index, section for undocumented
  exports, regenerated for changes resulting from API review.

guile-gnome-platform 2.15.95 - Andy Wingo, 2007-11-10
=====================================================

packaging changes
-----------------
* Build system work: add common makefile include for unit tests and a
  new check-coverage target to documentation builds.

atk
---
* Added API regression test suite.

gconf
-----
* Add API regression test suite.

* Add documentation, generated from upstream gtk-doc.

glib
----
* Added API regression unit tests for (gnome gw glib); previously only
  (gnome gobject) was tested.

* Add new code to check documentation coverage, integrated with the
  build system via the generate-docs.mk file in the `pkg' module.

* Fix documentation of class properties.

gnome-vfs
---------
* Add API regression test suite.

* Add documentation, generated from upstream gtk-doc.

The docs are suboptimal, as they do not talk at all the mapping between
gnome-vfs handles and scheme ports.

gtk
---
* Incompatible change: (gnome gtk) only exports GDK and GTK functions

(gnome gtk) used to re-export (oop goops), (gnome gobject), and a number
of other modules. This was changed so that we could guarantee a stable
interface for (gnome gtk); if you want other modules, you should
explicitly require them.

* Added API regression test suite.

libglade
--------
* Added documentation, generated from upstream gtk-doc.

* Added API regression test suite.

libgnome
--------
* Add documentation, generated from upstream gtk-doc.

* Add API regression test suite.

* Add documentation, generated from upstream gtk-doc.

libgnomeui
----------
* Add documentation, generated from upstream gtk-doc.

* Add API regression test suite.

-----
* Fix linking errors that made pangocairo unusable.

* Add API regression test suite.

=====================================================

packaging changes
-----------------
* Added infrastructure to make documentation.

atk
---
* Add documentation.

corba
-----
* Fix a compiler warning.

defs
----
* Remove .defs for libwnck, as they are not part of the platform.

glib
----
* Added documentation for the gobject and glib wrappers.

* Added unit tests which check that the (gnome gobject) and (gnome gw
  glib) APIs do not unintentionally change incompatibly.

* Added infrastructure for automatically producing documentation based
  on upstream GTK-Doc documentation.

* Fixed a number of API bugs; see the ChangeLog from 2006-09-01 and
  before for more details. Should not affect user's applications.

gtk
---
* Added documentation for the gtk and gdk wrappers.

pango
-----
* Added documentation for the pango and pangocairo wrappers.


guile-gnome-platform 2.15.93 - Andy Wingo, 2007-06-15
=====================================================

The most notable features of the release are that (1) it works, unlike
2.15.92; and (2) load time is much faster with the latest Guile 1.8 CVS.

cairo
-----
* Guile-Gnome-Cairo 2.15.92 was unusable; fixed. Unfortunately this
  means that we have to make another small shared library.

defs
----
* Fix pango defs to include pango-tabs.h.

glib
----
* Fix parsing of some options on arguments, such as (callee-owned),
  broken since 2007-05-05.

* Fix wrapper name of g-string-get-str.

* Fix some default values lost when glib.defs was autogenerated.

* Large speedup in load time of wrapped modules if we detect that
  Guile's module-make-local-var! is "lightweight", as is the case in the
  latest Guile 1.8 and HEAD CVS.

gtk
---
* Fix wrapping of GdkEvent, which had broken mysteriously.


guile-gnome-platform 2.15.92 - Andy Wingo, 2007-05-24

cairo
-----
* G-wrap integration for external guile-cairo module.

corba
-----
* Fix bug caused by change in guile-gnome-glib a while back that
  prevented CORBA from loading (#416570).

defs
----
* Update all defs files to the library versions corresponding to the
  GNOME 2.16 development platform. Defs files are now entirely
  autogenerated.

docs
----
* New platform release, no change.

gconf
-----
* Update to wrap GConf 2.18, corresponding to GNOME 2.16.

glib
----
* Update to GLib 2.10. Notably, this wraps the GBookmarkFile API, and
  the g_unicode and g_utf8 functions.

* Fix POSIX signal handling when running the main loop with Guile 1.8.

gnome-vfs
---------
* Update to wrap GNOME-VFS 2.16.

gtk
---

atk
---
* Update for defs parser changes.

docs
----
* Add "Getting started" chapter to tutorial.

gconf
-----
* Updates for defs parser changes.

glib
----
* Leave guile mode when calling into C, and enter when calling back into
  Guile, as in GClosures. Guile-gnome now supports multithreaded
  operation on Guile 1.8.

* The custom handler for g_warning() and friends was removed;
  guile-gnome will no longer scm_error when GLib logs.

* The defs parser automatically recognizes more output arguments, for
  example guint64*.

* Many bugfixes.

gnome-vfs
---------
* Updates for defs parser changes.

gtk
---
* Additions:
  - gtk-menu-popup accepts #f for parent widget arguments.

glib
----
* Operate on GTypeInstances via a generic registry of fundamental type
  operations. guile-gnome-glib comes with operations on GObject and
  GParamSpec; wrappers can define other operations for other fundamental
  types (such as GstMiniObject in GStreamer).

* Require G-Wrap 1.9.7, so that we can place all of our generics in the
  (gnome gw generics) module instead of in the root module.

* Avoid calling scm_ functions while in GC sweep, fixes crashes on Guile
  1.8.

* Add support macro for wrapping custom unclassed GTypes, such as
  GStreamer's fractions.

* Don't ignore 'null-ok (or other options) in cases like this:
  '("GMainContext*" "context" (null-ok) (default "NULL")).

* Remove SLIB dependency by folding in the needed functionality.

* Add support for gsize and gssize, both as input and output parameters.

* Add accessors for fields of GError.

* Other compile, memleak, and bug fixes.

gnome-vfs
---------
* Build updates for g-wrap.

* Don't attempt to wrap bonobo functions, they are not present in newer
  gnome-vfs.

* Fix locking, the --disable-deprecated mechanism, and some GCC 4
  warnings.

gtk
---
* Build updates for g-wrap, compile fixes for GCC 4.

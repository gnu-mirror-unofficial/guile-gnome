2007-11-15  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* tests.mk (GUILE):

	* h2def.py (get_type_pat): In method detection, require that the
	"object" type have a trailing *. Fixes incorrect detection of e.g.
	atk_role_get_name as a method wrapper, because otherwise you can't
	tell a difference between a pointer type and a scalar.

	* h2def.py: Add a command line argument --no-methods to disable
	the code that automatically tries to detect methods. Useful for
	example when generating glib defs.

2005-11-04  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	maximum path length.

2004-11-15  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh (record_check): Quote the bad value.
	Check for --prefix; if none is given, barf. People should be aware
	of guile's deficiencies.

	* autogen.sh: 
	* autogen-support.sh (--only-genconfigure): New option.

2004-11-13  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh (record_check): New function, should be called
	from within package.ac files to report whether a wrapper can be
	built or not.

2004-11-11  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* common.mk (%.scm guile-gnome-gw-%.c): Before loading g-wrap,
	load (gnome-@API_VERSION@). This will make sure that, when
	building against an installed guile-gnome, guile-gnome of the
	right version is available. My English sucks!

2004-10-13  Andreas Rottmann  <a.rottmann@gmx.at>

	* scripts/fork-archive-pkgs: Use -S option to "tla tag" instead of
	seperate archive-setup.

2004-10-26  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* common.mk: No more $guiledir, but there is $guilegnomedir, which
	is $datadir/guile-gnome-$apiversion. Adapt guilemoduledir ad
	guilegwmoduledir accordingly.

	* autogen-pkg.sh: No more --with-guiledir, we install to
	$datadir/guile-gnome-$apiversion.
	(API_VERSION): New substituted variable, the API version. Constant
	iff a release is backward compatible with the previous one. Starts
	at 0.

	right pkg-config file.
	(sort_pkgs): Echo the package into tsort even if it has no deps
	(e.g. docs/).
	Add a check for slib.

2004-10-12  Andreas Rottmann  <a.rottmann@gmx.at>

	* autogen-pkg.sh: Use tsort instead of hand-built package
	sorter. This fixes a bug when defs and defs-extra are both
	present.

	* autogen.sh: Fix sourcing for shells that don't search the
	current directory.

	* dev-environ.in: Remove special casing of glib for setting
	$LD_LIBRARY_PATH, use a new control file shlib-dirs.ac instead.

	the arguments.

	output.
	
2004-10-06  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* h2def.py: Change so we require one of --types, --procs, or
	--all. Change --enums-without-gtype to --c-enums. Add optional
	--with-header= option. Adjust logic to match.

2004-09-30  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh (autogen_pkg): An unrecognized config $i becomes
	guile-gnome-$i-YYYYMMDD+$source.

2004-09-27  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh: Require g-wrap = 1.9.3. g-wrap is in unstable
	releases, and as such we require specific micro versions.

	* AUTHORS: Updated.

2004-09-04  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

	* autogen-pkg.sh (autogen_pkg): For the dev build-config, set
	package=guile-gnome-dev, so that no dev distribution tarball
	escapes into the wild with the name `guile-gnome'. Print out the
	package name and version. Just print the sorted dependency list,
	not the progress of the sort.
	(GUILE_LIBS): Require g-wrap 1.9.1 or greater.

2004-06-27  Andy Wingo  <wingo@pobox.com>

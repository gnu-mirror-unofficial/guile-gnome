Things that are somehow ugly about this language binding.

* GObject properties are not directly mapped onto the somewhat
  equivalent way of doing things in GOOPS, slots. That's ameliorated by
  the presence of the 'get' and 'set' generics, which seem to work ok.

* Why is it again that the programmer would even want to care about the
  existence of GTypes?
